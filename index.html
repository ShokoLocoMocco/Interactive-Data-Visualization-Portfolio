As a graduate student, I found this to be an interesting dataset to explore because students, like myself, often drink caffeinated drinks to try to stay awake to get what needs to be done. But sometimes we may not necessarily be thinking about our calorie in take when drinking that caramel macchiato though. The visualiztion I intend to create will allow the user to explore beverages in the visualization by drink type, calorie count, and/or caffeine content.
