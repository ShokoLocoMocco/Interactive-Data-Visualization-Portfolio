      that has some popularly known caffeinated beverages with their nutrition facts. As a graduate student, I found this to be an interesting dataset to explore because students, like myself, often drink caffeinated drinks to try to stay awake to get what needs to be done. But sometimes we may not necessarily be thinking about our calorie in take when drinking that caramel macchiato though. The visualiztion I intend to create will allow the user to explore beverages in the visualization by drink type, calorie count, and/or caffeine content.

      For this project, I created a visualization that shows the Gender Pay Gap in the US. 
      My visualization is based off a similar visualization that uses the same 
      <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Qih5qBcuTntLbx7G7BzunRSOgGD0b_zc07sTzqiKGn4/edit#gid=0">dataset</a> 
      from the website 
      <a href="https://informationisbeautiful.net/data/">Information is Beautiful</a>. 
      The data was collected from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
      For this particular dataset, the data used was for full-time employees. 
      Part-time employment and freelance work were not included. 
      It is also important to note that the dataset was last updated in 2016. 
      The first two graphs in this project show the average annual salaries of specific occupational categories for both men and women. 
      The third one shows the gap between the two. 
      It becomes apparent that the jobs that generally pay the most are the ones where the pay gap between men and women is the largest.
