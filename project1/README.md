# Project 1 - Exploratory Visualization

## Prospectus

For this project, I will be exploring a [dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KYMUjrCulPtpUHwep9bVvsBvmVsDEbucdyRZ5uHCDxw/edit?hl%3Den_GB%26hl%3Den_GB#gid=1656295783) from the website [Information is Beautiful](https://informationisbeautiful.net/data/) that has some popularly known caffeinated beverages with their nutrition facts. As a graduate student, I find this to be an interesting topic to explore because students, like myself, are always trying to make sure we stay wired and awake to get what needs to be done. However, sometimes we may not necessarily think about our calorie in take when drinking that caramel macchiato. The visualiztion I intend to create will allow the user to explore each beverage by drink type, calorie count, and/or caffeine content.

## Sketches and Mockups

This data could be represented using any of the following visualizations:

- scatter plot with a dropdown filter
- table with a bar graph display
- circle map heirarchy with a click to zoom in feature

These are the sketches of how these visualiztions would look and interact.
