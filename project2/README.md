# Project 2 - Narrative Visualization

## Prospectus

For this project, I will be creating a visualization that shows the Gender Pay Gap in the US. My visualization is based off a similar visualization that uses the same [dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Qih5qBcuTntLbx7G7BzunRSOgGD0b_zc07sTzqiKGn4/edit#gid=0) from the website [Information is Beautiful](https://informationisbeautiful.net/data/). The data was collected from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. For this particular dataset, the data used was for full-time employees. Part-time employment and freelance work were not included. It is also important to note that the dataset was last updated in 2016. The first two graphs in this project show the average annual salaries of specific occupational categories for both men and women. The third one shows the gap between the two. It becomes apparent that the jobs that generally pay the most are the ones where the pay gap between men and women is the largest.
